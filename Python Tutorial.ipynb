    "# Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an interactive development environment for programming, data analysis and scientific calculations. It allows you to create and execute code in individual sections called cells and display text, graphics and results directly alongside the code. The tutorials are written in Jupyter Notebook for exactly these reasons. However, it should also be mentioned that Jupyter Notebook requires more computing time than many other development environments and for tasks such as the training of neural networks, the development environment should be changed. The following are some tips for working with Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint 1: Learn shortcuts\n",
    "Learning shortcuts in Jupyter Notebook can significantly increase your productivity. Here are some important shortcuts and recommendations:\n",
    "- Shift + Enter: Executes the current cell and moves to the next cell. If there is no next cell, a new one will be created.\n",
    "- A (in command mode): Inserts a new cell above the current cell.\n",
    "- B (in command mode): Inserts a new cell below the current cell.\n",
    "- D, D (double press D in command mode): Deletes the current cell.\n",
    "- Y (in command mode): Changes the type of the current cell to a code cell.\n",
    "- M (in command mode): Changes the type of the current cell to a Markdown cell.\n",
    "- X, C, V (in command mode): Cut, copy and paste cells.\n",
    "- H (in command mode): Opens the keyboard shortcut help to display more shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint 2: Use Markdown\n",
    "Markdown allows you to document your analyses and create clear, well-formatted notebooks."

    "- Headings: Use # for headings (e.g., # Heading 1, ## Heading 2).\n",
    "- Text formatting: You can make text bold (**bold**) or italic (*italic*).\n",
    "- Lists: Create ordered (1., 2., ...) or unordered (-, *) lists.\n",
    "- Links: Add links with [text](URL).\n",
    "- Images: Include images with ![Description](URL).\n",

    "### Hint 3: Modularize code\n",
    "\n",
    "It is advisable to split your code in Jupyter Notebooks into smaller, easy to understand cells and add comments to improve readability. This makes debugging, maintenance and collaboration easier. You can organize code into functions or classes and test them in separate cells. This also promotes the reusability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint 4: Kernel restart\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes your code in Jupyter Notebook may not work as expected or you may experience resource problems. In such cases, you can restart the kernel, i.e. the computing unit, without closing the entire notebook. To do this, go to \"Kernel\" in the menu and select \"Restart\". This will reset all variables and states and you can start from the beginning without having to close and reopen the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint 5: Data backup\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to back up the code regularly to avoid data loss. Use the \"Save\" function or press Ctrl + S (or Cmd + S on Mac) to save your progress. It's also worth using external backup methods like GitHub in combination with GitKraken to track versions of your notebook and make sure you don't lose your work."

If you have no previous knowledge of Python, it is worth acquiring it via YouTube tutorials (Recommendation: [Python As Fast as Possible - Learn Python in ~75 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VchuKL44s6E)) and programming projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Variables, data types, operators and expressions:\n",

    "- int: Whole numbers, e.g. x = 5\n",
    "- float: Floating point numbers, e.g. y = 3.14\n",
    "- str: Character strings, e.g. name = \"John\"\n",
    "- bool: Boolean values (True/False), e.g. is_true = True\n",

    "- Logical operators (and, or, not)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mathematical operators:\n",
    "- $+$ (addition): Performs an addition of numbers. Example: result = 5 + 3 gives result with the value 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $-$ (Subtraction): Performs a subtraction of numbers. Example: result = 10 - 4 gives result with the value 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $*$ (Multiplication): Performs a multiplication of numbers. Example: result = 7 * 2 gives result with the value 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $/$ (division): Performs a division of numbers. Example: result = 20 / 4 gives result with the value 5.0 (float).\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\%$ (modulo): Returns the remainder of a division. Example: remainder = 10 % 3 results in remainder with the value 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $**$ (power): Raises one number to the power of another. Example: result = 2 ** 3 gives result with the value 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Comparison operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $==$ (Equal): Checks whether two values are equal. Example: is_equal = (5 == 5) results in is_equal with the value True.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $!=$ (Unequal): Checks whether two values are unequal.\n",
    "    Example: is_not_equal = (5 != 3) results in is_not_equal with the value True.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $<$ (Less than): Checks whether one value is smaller than another. Example: is_smaller = (2 < 5) results in is_smaller with the value True.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $>$ (Greater than): Checks whether one value is greater than another. Example: is_greater = (7 > 4) results in is_greater with the value True.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $<=$ (Less than or equal to): Checks whether one value is less than or equal to another. Example: is_smaller_or_equal = (3 <= 3) results in is_smaller_or_equal with the value True.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $>=$ (greater than or equal to): Checks whether one value is greater than or equal to another. Example: is_greater_or_equal = (6 >= 6) results in is_greater_or_equal with the value True.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logical operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- and: Combines two conditions, and the overall statement is true if both conditions are true. Example: result = (True and False) results in result with the value False.\n",
    "\n",
    "- or: Links two conditions, and the overall statement is true if at least one condition is true. Example: result = (True or False) results in result with the value True.\n",
